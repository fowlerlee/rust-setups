# rust-setups

## Welcome
Welcome to the rust setups repo for commond rust patterns in different domains. You might find some web frontend code here and there and perhaps some bash as well. Its mostly rust though.

## What it contains
The domains are quite varied by broadly encompass: networks, systems development,  web, dapps and defi. The latter two are primarily for the Internet Computer. Any wasm is used as needed. Thus I suggest you get the wat2wasm compiler to get a readable format of the wasm binaries.
